((2024-04-25 07.29.03.781182)) CUSTOMER: , especially with the kind of risky work I do as a stunt actor.

I think my, my, my purpose today would be to make sure that you can understand options and of products but I would strongly recommend to start with that you take a simple term insurance policy for yourself if you think you know that's something that you've heard of before.
((2024-04-25 07.29.45.651678)) AGENT: If not, I can give you more details.
((2024-04-25 07.29.47.087138)) CUSTOMER: No, I've heard of term insurance before. But I'm curious, what makes Set

((2024-04-25 07.29.52.914241)) CUSTOMER: Set For Life from FWD different from other term insurance
((2024-04-25 07.29.56.391174)) CUSTOMER: policies is how it blends investment options, right?

((2024-04-25 07.30.01.595146)) CUSTOMER: Can I choose where to invest, or is it managed for me?
((2024-04-25 07.30.30.497903)) AGENT: Well, I I think the set for life product is a limited pay product and and it does give you some guaranteed returns over a period of time and you have the option to pay a shorter period of premiums as opposed to a longer period of payment. Yeah. So it's a better life policy.
((2024-04-25 07.30.32.343333)) CUSTOMER: I see. And what exactly qualifies as an accident for the accidental death
((2024-04-25 07.30.36.643653)) CUSTOMER: benefit in this policy?
((2024-04-25 07.30.38.255372)) CUSTOMER: Like, does it cover things related to my stunt work, or are there specific exclusions I should be aware of?
((2024-04-25 07.31.08.876953)) AGENT: Well, I think generally speaking it covers all accidents and that's the very purpose of the policy. I think as an underwriter, you know, training that I've, I've, I've been provided, I think we will be able to accept your profession as part of this policy and and I'll be happy to sort of give you a quotation as well if you please.
((2024-04-25 07.31.10.772802)) CUSTOMER: Alright, that sounds interesting. And what about the payment period options? Are they flexible? Can
((2024-04-25 07.31.15.112757)) CUSTOMER: I opt for a shorter payment plan but extend my coverage for a longer duration?
((2024-04-25 07.31.19.116317)) CUSTOMER: How does that affect my premiums?
((2024-04-25 07.31.47.837877)) AGENT: Uh, well, we have uh, multiple payment options for you. Uh, we actually have four options. You could choose from A5 Pay or A7 Pay, A10 Pay, or a Whole Life payment which is annual payment every year. So the choice is yours, and it really depends on you know how you'd like to plan yourself financially and your income stream to support your payment plans.
